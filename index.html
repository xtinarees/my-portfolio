            <p>After 10 years as a professional journalist writing about the day’s biggest stories, I decided that I wanted to learn to write code. Because what’s a bigger story than tech?</p>
            <p>Now I am a freelance web developer and full-stack software engineer seeking full-time employment in the field. This is less of a career change than the logical next step for me. I’ve always sought out new challenges. Curiosity, self-reliance, and grit are fundamental to both journalism and tech. I’m able to draw on my decade of experience working for digital publications as I push myself to become a better developer every day.</p>
            <p>I have a bachelor’s degree from the University of North Texas and I'm working on a web development certification from Southern Methodist University. I live in Dallas, but am open to remote work. By the time I’m sharing this portfolio with prospective employers, I will be comfortable in programming languages like blah blah blah and experienced in databases and yada yada and good at coding this and that. Just as important, I have the tenacity and drive to figure out new problems. I have a positive, upbeat attitude and embrace collaboration. Oh, and I am well-versed in Googling things.</p>  
            <p>In my free time, I love to read, go to the movies, try new restaurants with my wife, and ride my bike all over the city.</p>
            <p>Here you’ll find links to some of my work and to my resume. I hope you’ll take a look around. And don’t hesitate to contact me. I’m easy to reach.</p>
